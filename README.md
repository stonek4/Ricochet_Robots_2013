The purpose of this project was to solve a problem that is similar to a board game.  The robots and board
are given by an input file and the program needs to figure out how to move the robots around the board in
order to reach the goal.   

The program can be run by compiling main.cpp, board.cpp and board.h together, then running the executable using
the puzzle input file as an argument like:

./a.out puzzle.txt

Please give the program some time to run.
